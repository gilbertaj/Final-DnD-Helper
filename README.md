 # Links-Rocket-cmsc355-android-app
cmsc355-android-app created for Links-Rocket


The user stories that we completed this iteration were UserStory9_DieRoller, UserStory MainMenu, UserStory3_ClassSelection, and 
UserStory8_NameAppearanceAndBackground.

In order to set up a good foundation for the app in coming iterations, all of the navigation was set up in the app in this
iteration. All of the RecyclerViews and their adapters were also skeletoned in preparation for when we have the data to populate
those lists. The die roller functionality and character creation activities were the largest steps in app content this iteration.

We have encountered a lot of difficulties figuring out how to use git, manage a repository, and be a part of a project that 
has multiple contributors.

(Iteration 2)

Completed Character Page, Save System, UserStory10_RaceSelection, UserStory1_ItemList, UserStory6_SpellSelection, UserStory5_FeatSelection, and UserStory2_AttributeGeneration user stores in this iteration.
